APIs are the backbone of modern applications. Securing an API is crucial to protect sensitive data and ensure only authorized users can access your services.

Steps to Secure an API

1. Authentication: Use tokens like OAuth2 or API keys to verify users.
2. Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per user.
3. Encryption: Use HTTPS to encrypt traffic between clients and your API.
4. Validation: Validate all user input to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

By implementing these measures, you can build a robust API that keeps data secure.
