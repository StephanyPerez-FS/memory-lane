Password hashing is a crucial security measure that protects user credentials by storing a cryptographically transformed version of passwords rather than plain text.

Why Use Password Hashing?

When users sign up, their passwords should never be stored directly. Instead, they are transformed using a hashing algorithm such as:

- bcrypt: Introduces computational cost, making brute-force attacks harder.
- PBKDF2: Uses a salt and multiple iterations to slow down attacks.
- Argon2: The most recommended hashing algorithm due to memory resistance.

By implementing password hashing, websites protect user data from breaches, making authentication systems more secure.
