Express.js is a minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for routing, middleware, and request handling.

One of the things I recently implemented was a RESTful API using Express.js. This involved setting up routes, handling different HTTP methods, and managing middleware for tasks like authentication and logging. It was a great way to understand how Express.js streamlines backend development.
