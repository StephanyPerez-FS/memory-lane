They allow applications to communicate with each other and share data.\n\nKey Steps to Building an API\n\n1.Choose a Framework: Popular frameworks like Express.js (Node.js) or Flask (Python) simplify API creation.\n\n2.Define Routes: Determine the endpoints your API will expose (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`). 3.Handle HTTP Methods: Implement methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. 4.Add Middleware: Use middleware for logging, authentication, and validation. 5.Document Your API: Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document and test your API.\n\nBuilding APIs allows developers to create scalable, reusable services that power modern web applications. Start small, iterate, and test often!\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/building-an-api/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
