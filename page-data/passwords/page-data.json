Instead, they are transformed using a hashing algorithm such as:\n\n- bcrypt: Introduces computational cost, making brute-force attacks harder.\n- PBKDF2: Uses a salt and multiple iterations to slow down attacks.\n- Argon2: The most recommended hashing algorithm due to memory resistance.\n\nBy implementing password hashing, websites protect user data from breaches, making authentication systems more secure.\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/passwords/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
